# Roulette game

This project was created as a school project in graphical user interfaces course.
It's made with JavaFX (needed to run the program).

Game works like roulette. Player has some money and inserts chips on the table to bet certain numbers.
After all bets are placed ball is spinned and player wins or loses depending on where the ball lands.

This version has only simple prints for win/loss and total win/loss.
I'm planing to future develope this, to calculate differrent probabilities for wins etc.

This version has a minor bug, when betting streets (all three numbers on one row) 
the table moves to right to make room for the chip on the screen. This will be fixed in future versions hopefully.
